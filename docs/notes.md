## Graphic notes

- Match certain chars with face pictures for the message box
- 3 shield types: Agorian, Black and Grey elites
- Black elites' fight char graphs shouldn't have blood, as they survive the fight
- Dawnflower has to be blue: ObjectAll up middle 1
- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
  - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
  - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
- zlightup2 - The two only differs in their focus point. (Essentially the second is the same as the first one, just lifted a little)
- Objekt9 has Leon Anvar's sword, so it has to match with an elite soldier's look
