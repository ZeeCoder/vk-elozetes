Graphic notes:

- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
  - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
  - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
- zlightup2 - The two only differs in their focus point. (Essentially the second is the same as the first one, just lifted a little)
- Objekt9 has Leon Anvar's sword, so it has to match with an elite soldier's look

issues

- When talking to Tren: "Ja..." has Dorer's face
- Tren talk: "Pfff... Majd akkor szolj" has Dorer's face
- WHen we visit the gland again at dawn "Hmm... semmi, nincs semmi" => wrong height
- At the end of the intro a music briefly plays before we're transported to day 2
- No music at all while we're walking to the training grounds
- NO music at all during the wolf fight areas
- the hidden glend left from the wolves should have 25 setalium, so that we can buy an extra potion and coctail
- When we read the stone names at the hidden glend at the wolves on the right hand side, escaval steps too far from us
- running minigame should decrease the circles by 1 only, not 10
- you can get stuck with the barrel at dreamland. make sure movement is done in a way that's not mandatory, so that the engine doesn't get stuck
- Dreamworld own selves room: when they shout Dorer's name and he says: "Mintha escaval hangja lett volna" his face is not shown on the message box
- Think of replacing the explosion effect that whitedorer does with something else
- "Dorer nekunk szuksegunk van... kettonk sorsa" => wrong height
- the wines should be climbed automatically on touch instead of hitting enter
