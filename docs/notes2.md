Mountain chip set:
- Are both boulders with different colors in use?

todo:
- A satorbelso foldjet le kell cserelni sivarra a 3. napon. (Hozza kell adni a chipsethez is)
- Note how characters can pass through each tile for each tileset for the graphic designer
- Make a custom game with the maps for the designer, with save files on each map. This way he can just swap things out to see how it works in game
- Remove Kendel_ut Leida_ut while replacing the chars in the BS 
- Check if the dusk1 and dusk2 panoramas are used at all
- Think about removing object4 orig vegetations

Graphic notes:
- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
    - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
    - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
