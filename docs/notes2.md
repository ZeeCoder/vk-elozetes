Graphic notes:

- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
  - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
  - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
- zlightup2 - The two only differs in their focus point. (Essentially the second is the same as the first one, just lifted a little)
