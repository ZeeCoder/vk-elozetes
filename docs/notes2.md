Graphic notes:

- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
  - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
  - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
- zlightup2 - The two only differs in their focus point. (Essentially the second is the same as the first one, just lifted a little)
- Objekt9 has Leon Anvar's sword, so it has to match with an elite soldier's look

issues:

- before "next up is blad leader" it seemed like text was skipped
- the gland to the west might have dawnflowers on it
- after end of intro, it takes too long to show the next day
- Dorer: I can barely hodl my sword: he's not holding it though
- Elite should charge with his sword before him, not behind
- two elites are thrown away way too fast and way too far
- when dorer falls slowly (vissza2) he faces in the wrong direction
- when a wounded one comes in on the 3rd day, there should be a tent ripping noise

dreamland

- when we briefly see the others in the tent it's way too dark
- what are you talking about?... < wrong"?"
- I won't allow it! missing space

3rd day:

- we thought... => messa\ge box weirdly shows while leida slowly moves
- when braun rushes in, leida should be shoved away, she shouldn't jump
- dulah told you he needs to reste! typo
- BRAUN!!! => dulah's face should show, not braun's
- I'll untie you => dorer becomes red
- after what did dulah didn't realise, it skips to Dorer saying "What?"
- When observing the wounded one, another message is skipped to " can you tell me"
- maybe later dorer => wrong height
- saving in leida's tent on the 3rd day weirdly starts the hell girl music
