Graphic notes:

- the left black tile for the "Tent" chip set has to be 000 pure black, as I'm using that for scenes where I want to hide everything. The other one to the right of it is the one that's actually used for tents.
- The tent tileset have three floor type. Two fully or partially grass, and one barren. These should match up with the floor types of "Forest" and "Mountain"
  - Also use the animations char (butterflies)
  - Also use tiere2 butterfly on the dark forest chipset
- zlightup2 - The two only differs in their focus point. (Essentially the second is the same as the first one, just lifted a little)
- Objekt9 has Leon Anvar's sword, so it has to match with an elite soldier's look

issues:

- before "next up is blad leader" it seemed like text was skipped
- the gland to the west might have dawnflowers on it
- after end of intro, it takes too long to show the next day

- seems like the minigame is still running too fast for some reason
- Barun starts shouting way too soon
- Braun should leave after Dorer faster, and take a couple steps backwards, not just one
- minigame is jerky
- minigame end: a lot of wait for some reason
- need to restore the graphics where Dorer trips
- after "it really doesn't matter!" ... should have dorer's face
- when they let space for Dorer, he's way too fast and pushes against evorn
- "after heh a predictable outcome" zigo briefly turns red
- Dorer is extremely fast when meeting the elites
- Elite (Lent) should be bottom
- Elit(Fent)
- Tobbszor is => not translated
- Dorer: I can barely hodl my sword: he's not holding it though
- Elite should charge with his sword before him, not behind
- When white dorer enters him, he changes to red briefly
- two elites are thrown away way too fast and way too far
