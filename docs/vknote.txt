todo
- show names with the faces in the message boxes
- write a walkthrough
- Come up with a different name for "Eron"
- Replace Kendel and Leida with Eron and Evorn in the BS
- When the new designs are under discussion, the elites shouldn't look dead, as they'll survive the fight itself
- get rid of all the unnecessary assets, then all the bits inside the assets that I don't need. (That way it'll be easier for a graphic designer to redo only what's necessary)
